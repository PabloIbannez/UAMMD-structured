Tutorials introduction
======================

The best way to learn how to use UAMMD-structured is to go through the
tutorials. They are designed to be read in order, as each one builds on
the previous one. The tutorials use pyUAMMD to set up the simulations input,
this is not necessary to use UAMMD-structured, but it is recommended.

In the Toturial 0 we will learn how to install UAMMD-structured and
pyUAMMD. The following tutorials will show how to use UAMMD-structured
starting from the most basic example, a simple ideal gas, to more
complex examples like a Lennard-Jones fluid, a polymer melt ...

Tutorial are thought to be read in order, as each one builds on the
previous one.

Despite the code is provided in the tutorials, sometimes could be
that some of the code is missing or additional files are needed. A fully
working version of the tutorials can be found in the folder
`Examples/Tutorials/` of the UAMMD-structured repository.
