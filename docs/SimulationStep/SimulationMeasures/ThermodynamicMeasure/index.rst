ThermodynamicMeasure
====================

The ThermodynamicMeasure category contains simulation steps that focus on measuring and analyzing thermodynamic properties of the system. These measures provide insights into the energetic and statistical behavior of the simulated system, which are crucial for understanding its physical and chemical properties.

This category includes the following types of measures:

1. Comprehensive Thermodynamic Analysis (ThermodynamicQuantityMeasure)
2. Free Energy Calculations (ThermodynamicIntegration)
3. Energy Decomposition Analysis (InteractorsListEnergyMeasure)

These measures are particularly useful for studying system equilibration, phase transitions, binding free energies, and the relative importance of different interaction types in the system. They provide essential data for connecting microscopic simulations to macroscopic observables and for comparing simulation results with experimental data.
