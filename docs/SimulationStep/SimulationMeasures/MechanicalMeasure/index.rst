MechanicalMeasure
=================

The MechanicalMeasure category contains simulation steps that focus on measuring mechanical properties and interactions within the system. These measures provide detailed information about forces, stresses, and other mechanical quantities that are crucial for understanding the system's behavior and properties.

This category includes the following types of measures:

1. Stress Analysis (StressMeasure)
2. Force Analysis (PairwiseForceMeasure, ForceBetweenSetsMeasure)
3. Energy Landscape Analysis (HessianMeasure)

These measures are particularly useful for studying material properties, molecular interactions, and system stability. They can provide insights into local and global mechanical behavior, helping researchers understand complex systems at various scales.
