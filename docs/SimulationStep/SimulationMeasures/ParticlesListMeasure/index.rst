ParticlesListMeasure
====================

The ParticlesListMeasure category contains simulation steps that focus on measuring properties of specific particles or groups of particles in the system. These measures allow for detailed analysis of particular interactions, conformations, or energetics of selected particles throughout the simulation.

This category includes the following types of measures:

1. Distance-based measures (DistancesMeasure, ContactsMeasure)
2. Angular measures (AnglesMeasure, DihedralsMeasure)
3. Energetic measures (PotentialMeasure)

These measures are particularly useful for tracking specific interactions, monitoring structural changes, or analyzing the behavior of particles of interest within the larger system.
