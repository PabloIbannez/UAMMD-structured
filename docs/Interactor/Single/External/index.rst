External
========

External interactions model the effect of external fields on the system. They are also used
to apply boundary constraints to the system, such planes, spheres ...

Regarding the external fields, there are several options, some of then are derived from an
analytical expression while others are derived from tabulated data.

The following is a list of the available external interactions:
